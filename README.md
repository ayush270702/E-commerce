# SaleSwipe

An e-commerce site built with Django would allow users to post ads for products and search for products based on various criteria. Users would be able to register for the site and create a profile. Once registered, users could post product updates, including details such as the product's name, description, price, and images. Users could also delete a product listing if the item is no longer available for sale.

To search for products, users could browse categories, use a keyword search. Once a user finds a product of interest, they could view the details of the product and contact the seller.

In addition, users could view products posted by other users and see the profile of the seller who posted the product. This would allow them to view other products the seller has for sale and get an idea of their reputation as a seller.

Overall, the site would provide a platform for users to connect with each other and exchange information about products for sale.
